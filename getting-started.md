# Installation

**On macOS, you can `brew install [coming soon ...]` or [download the binary from
GitHub](https://remonics.ai) and drop it somewhere on your path.** If this
build isn't right for your architecture, the only other option for now is to build it manually from
source.

## Building from Source

### Clone the git repo

`dev clone [coming soon ...]` if you work at Shopify, or:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Asthma-Guardian/example
cd example
```
